This repository contains relevant files for producing coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations (CG-MD) for contacts between two hair surfaces including squeeze-out and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations (NEMD).

**Example:** 25% hair damage (virgin hair) surface - squeeze-out and NEMD protocols available.

* Squeeze-out: Perform squeeze-out simulations in a water bath.
    1. Energy minimization (run.in.min)
    2. Brief NVT equilibration (run.in.nvt)
    3. Brief bulk pressure equilibration (run.in.npt)
    4. Surface compression at constant normal load of p=10MPa (run.in.comp)
    
* NEMD: Sliding between two hair surfaces at constant amount of water (from squeeze-out above) @ p=10MPa and v=0.1m/s.
    1. Energy minimization (run.in.min)
    2. Brief NVT equilibration (run.in.nvt)
    3. Compression at constant normal load (run.in.comp)
    4. NEMD (sliding) at v=0.1m/s (run.in.slide)
    
**Initial_Configs:** Initial LAMMPS topology files for wet hair contacts for squeeze-out simulations (01_SqueezeOut) and NEMD simulations at a normal contact pressure of 10MPa (02_NEMD) for all degrees of surface damage considered in our work. Initial configurations for NEMD simulations at other normal pressures can be obtained by running squeeze-out simulations. Dry contact NEMD simulations can be run by deleting all water molecules from the initial wet contacts.

**Moltemplate:** Scripts for setting up the water bath (squeeze-out) and water at contact (NEMD) for own simulations at arbitrary system dimensions and water content.
